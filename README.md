A teen looking for improve skills and knowledge into Cyber Security Path. I've ever experienced many situations where I been face by face with Data Science, A.Is (machine learning) and Cloud computing, but one thing hit me such a way that call my attention is Cyber Security where generraly leave me to another world:

- Manage Kali Linux
- Make Scripts and exploits
- Monitoring acess
- Pentest
- Bug Bounty

Including all the key words I do not consider myself as a Hacker, I ussualy say that i'm "Half Hacker" = A guy with the same knowledge as a Hacker but do not practice so much as should. So, here i join trying to improve my skills to get or work with cyber security very soon, but of course that I need to practice my skills ["I know ;)"] but I don't do it a because I don't have time to study so much (Reason: school), of course that I study a litlle bit going to there but isn't enought. Other big problem is that i have a slow and bad computer where a downloading is generraly slow than normal, and all this stuff contribute negatively to delay learning.
